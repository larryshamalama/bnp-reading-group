# Agenda

While tentative, below is a schedule of what I had in mind.

### Preliminary readings (more as references than to actually read)

- Probability theory: [Williams (1991)](http://static.stevereads.com/papers_to_read/probability_with_martingales_williams_.pdf) Chapters 1 to 3
- Bayesian decision theory: [The Bayesian Choice](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-71599-1) Chapter 2 or [Bernardo and Smith (1994)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470316870) for a wild ride
- Everything else (i.e. practical and useful) Bayesian theory: [Bayesian Data Analysis](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/BDA3.pdf) by Andrew Gelman and everything else he writes

### Meeting 1

- Philosophical questions: why go nonparametric? What does it mean to go nonparametric in a Bayesian framework?
- Main reading: [Bayesian nonparametric data analysis](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319189673) by Mueller et al. (2015) Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 section 2.1
- Can also talk about Gaussian processes (reference: [Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book0.html) by Murphy (2012) Chapter 15

### Meeting 2

- Everything about Dirichlet Processes, Part 1
	- Mueller et al. (2015) Chapter 2, section 2.1 and 2.2 (maybe minus subsection 2.2.2)
	- Code! See notebooks (can also use R)
- References: [Ferguson (1973)](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-1/issue-2/A-Bayesian-Analysis-of-Some-Nonparametric-Problems/10.1214/aos/1176342360.full) and [Ferguson (1974)](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-2/issue-4/Prior-Distributions-on-Spaces-of-Probability-Measures/10.1214/aos/1176342752.full).

### Meeting 3

- Dirichlet Process Mixtures
